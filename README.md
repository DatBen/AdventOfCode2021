### Few comments :

### - automatic init:

If you don't run on Ubuntu and if you don't have mozilla, you can't use the command to get automatically the input of the day. Moreover you need to have sqlite3 and to have mozilla closed !

### - day 6:

This day the naive approach worked well for the first part but in the second part, as the lisst was growing
exponetially the memory overflowed, so it was necessary to take a new approach with a list of static size.

### - day 7:

To solve part 2, we tested all solutions and selected the best one. A mathematical approach would directly have found the solution.
